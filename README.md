# Bitcoin_price_prediction
Data Science project in R programming language

Here we are going to predict the closing price and
will be showing the price trends for the same. These predicted
prices will be based on the previously observed and studied
data form a dataset taken for building the project. The main
input parameters which will be taken into consideration is that
the opening price of the Bitcoin , how much it has gone high
during the span of the day and the low price it has acquired.
On this basis, the price at which it is going to close at the end
of the day is the key prediction we have done while framing
the various machine learning models. We have used the
Multiple Linear Regression[MLR], Random Forest Algorithm
and Support Vector Regression[SVR] for prediction purpose.
Also we have plotted various graphs which will depict the
actual and the predicted value trends for clear visualization
purpose.
